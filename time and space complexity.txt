using recursion-->
           Time Complexity = T(n)=T(n-1) + T(n-2)
           Space Complexity = O(n)
using DP-->
           Time Complexity =O(n)
           Space Complexity = O(1)
Space optimization of DP-->
           Time Complexity =O(n)
           Space Complexity = O(1)
using the power of matrix method-->
           Time Complexity =O(n)
           Space Complexity = O(1)
optimized matrix method-->
            Time Complexity =O(log n)
            Space Complexity = O(log n)
recursicve method in O(log n) time -->
            Time Complexity =O(log n)
            Space Complexity = O(n)
using direct formula-->
            Time Complexity =O(log n)
            Space Complexity = O(1)
DP using Memorization-->
            Time Complexity =O(n)
            Space Complexity = O(1)
